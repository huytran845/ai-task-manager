# Fantasktic  
Fantasktic is a code showcase that lets you manage projects and tasks in one place. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite, Sonner notifications, and powered by Google’s Gemini for AI-driven task suggestions, it’s a snapshot of my front-end, back-end, and AI integration knowledge. It's an AI task and project management system where users can create and manage their own tasks, or allow the AI to generate potential tasks for them.
